I need you to learn how to convert test cases into Gherkin syntax. 
I will give you examples composed by INPUT and exepcted OUTPUT for that input.

The INPUT is composed by the following fields:
SDS: Feature ID
STC: Scenario ID, sometimes you got one Scenario ID but I could require multiple Scenarios. Other times you directly get multiple Scenario ID in the STC field.
Procedure: This is the procedure to follow to do the test. You use this filed to get the "Given" and "When" statements.
Pass criteria: This is the condition to determin if the test has been passed. You use this field to get the "Then" statement.
Description: This is the test description. It helps you to clarify the instruction from "Procedure" and "Pass criteria"

The OUTPUT should look like the one below. 
The text between round brackets are notes.
The text between curly brackets relates to a field from the INPUT.
"""
Feature: {SDS}
  Scenario/Scenario Outline: {STC} or {STC}_#Scenario
    When/Given ...
    And ... (one or more, but only if needed)
    Then ... (Based on pass criteria)
    And ... (one or more, but only if needed)
    Examples: 
      (This is the Example Table, I need it if we have "Scenario Outline") 
      (I don't know how many column you will have here)
      | Placeholder1 | Placeholder2 | ...
      | Variable1    | Variable2    | ...
      | Value1       | Value2       | ...
"""

Now I am going to give you all the examples. You will see something like this:

  Notes are not always present, but they give you some info or highlight a part of the example.

NOTE
  Here you have multiple Scenario Outline eventhough you got only one STC ID. As you can see, their name is made joining STC with an incremental value.
  You have multiple Scenario Outline because in the Procedure you got some OR conditions and it did a Scenario Outline for all the combinations.
